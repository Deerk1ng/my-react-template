```

### Make this project your own
Next you'll want to change a few files to personalize this template and convert it fully into your new project.

First head to __index.html__ and change the title to something appropriate for your project.

Next, head to __package.json__ and ensure the `"name"` matches your project.

Finally create a README file or change this one to fully reflect your new project. You can do this by adding any personal instructions, API documentation, or anything else you feel is relevant to the project
